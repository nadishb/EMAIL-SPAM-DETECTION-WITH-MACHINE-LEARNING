Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as spam or not spam (ham). This will help in filtering out unwanted emails and improving email security.

Dataset:
The project will use a dataset containing labeled emails. The dataset typically includes the following attributes:

Email Content (text)
Label (spam or ham)
Steps Involved:

Data Collection:

Obtain the email dataset from reliable sources such as the Enron email dataset or public datasets available on platforms like Kaggle.
Ensure the dataset includes a good mix of spam and ham emails for balanced training.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean the email content by removing HTML tags, special characters, and stop words.
Convert the email text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Tokenize the email text into words and perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
Feature Extraction:

Use techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), or word embeddings to convert the text data into numerical features that can be used for machine learning.
Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80-20 or 70-30 split) to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
Model Selection:

Choose appropriate classification algorithms such as:
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Train multiple models to compare their performance.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train the selected models using the training set.
Evaluate the models using the testing set.
Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the best hyperparameters for the models.
Retrain the models with the optimized hyperparameters.
Model Deployment:

Choose the best-performing model.
Save the model using serialization techniques like pickle or joblib.
Create a simple user interface or API to make predictions on new emails.
Conclusion:

Summarize the findings and the model's performance.
Discuss potential improvements and future work.
Tools and Libraries:

Python
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and evaluation
NLTK or SpaCy for natural language processing
Jupyter Notebook or any other IDE for development
